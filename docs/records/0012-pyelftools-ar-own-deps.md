**D12 — `pyelftools` and `ar` are `cibuildmp`'s own dependencies, not
something it installs at build time.**
Neither is binutils. `ar` (PyPI `ar`, 1.0.1, "Access ar archive files") is a
pure-Python package that `mpy_ld.py` imports via `from ar import Archive` in
a `try`/`except`; `pyelftools` is imported directly as `elftools.elf`. No
system binary involved for either.

`ar` is formally optional in `mpy_ld.py` (`Archive = None` when the import
fails) but not practically optional for `cibuildmp`: it is needed whenever
`MPY_LD_FLAGS` contains `-l...a`, which is always true under
`LINK_RUNTIME=1` — the case bclibc uses to link `libm.a`. So both are
ordinary dependencies, not an `extra`; both are small and pure-Python, so the
cost is low. `pyelftools` should be pinned wide (`pyelftools>=0.29`), not
exact — the pin is shared across every MicroPython tag a user's config
builds, and the surface `mpy_ld.py` actually uses is narrow and stable, but a
tight pin would let one old tag break the whole tool.

Mechanism is the one already verified for `CROSS=` under M2:
`py/dynruntime.mk` line 10 assigns `PYTHON = python3` with a plain `=`, never
`override`, so a command-line variable wins. `cibuildmp` passes
`PYTHON=<sys.executable>` alongside `CROSS=`, and `make` runs `mpy_ld.py`
under the interpreter that already has both packages — the "isolated
environment" this used to require comes for free, since `uv tool install`
(**D8**) already puts `cibuildmp` in its own venv and the system interpreter
is never touched. This removes the first M3 checkbox as separate work; it is
one more argument on the `make` command line.
